# Layout

## Database

going to need a database to hold the user contrubutions. it would be the main database. i dont kow to much about creating databases so this is a good time to brushin up on my skills.

## app-layout

i want to create this application using flutter, that way it is accesable in multiple places and i only have to update one set of codes. seeing how i am still in the middle of learning flutter, it might take me awhile to actaully get the base concept down of how i want the application to look.
