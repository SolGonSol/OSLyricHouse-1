Pretty Girl"

Polaroid of you dancing in my room <br>
I want to remember <br>
I think it was about noon <br>
It's getting harder to understand, to understand<br>
How you felt in my hands (in my hands)<br>

I could be a pretty girl<br>
I'll wear a skirt for you<br>
And I could be a pretty girl<br>
Shut up when you want me to<br>
I could be a pretty girl<br>
Won't ever make you blue<br>
I could be a pretty girl<br>
I'll lose myself in you<br>

I was so blinded by you, now I cry<br>
Just thinking bout the fool that I was<br>
I was such a fool!<br>
I'm alone now but itâ€™s better for me<br>
I don't need all your negativity<br>

I could be a pretty girl<br>
I'll wear a skirt for you<br>
And I could be a pretty girl<br>
Shut up when you want me to<br>
I could be a pretty girl<br>
I'll never make you blue<br>
I could be a pretty girl<br>
I'll lose myself in you<br>
