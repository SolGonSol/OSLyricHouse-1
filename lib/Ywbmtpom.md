# You Won't Be Missing That Part Of Me
## Melody's Echo Chamber

Because 
I lied with all my heart
Because
It's time to change my life

Of course

You won't be missing that part of me
It's all you need
When telling everyone that you're free
Hold on, you'll see
It won't be that hard to forget me
I hope you won't

I've endured
Endearing soul
Wish you knew
I was too young

Because
You cried
Doesn't mean you
Can talk to me
When you decide

At least

You won't be missing that part of me
It's all you need
When telling everyone that you're free
Hold on
You'll see
It won't be that hard to forget me
I hope you won't

Will you forgive that I left
Should've predicted why you would hate
