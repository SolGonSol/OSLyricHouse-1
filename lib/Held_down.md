# Held Down
## Laura Marling

I woke up, it was four in the morning
Clear as all hell that you'd already gone
(Gone, gone, gone) <br>
Your note said, "Dear, you know I hate to disappear
But the days are short and the nights are getting long" 
(Long, long, long) <br>

And I just meant to tell you
That I don't want to let you down
(Down, down, down) <br>
And I just meant to tell you
That I don't want to get you wrong
(Wrong, wrong, wrong) <br>

Think about now with my legs wrapped around you
How many times before have you seen me run?
(Run, run, run) <br>
It's a cruel kinda twist that you'd leave like this
Just drop my wrist and say, "Well, that's us done"
(Done, done, done) <br>

I was just gonna tell you
That I don't want to let you down
(Down down down)
Get lost in the crowd
Seen or unseen
Say what you mean

You sent me a book, which you gave half a look
But I just don't care for, and I cannot get through
(Through, through, through) <br>
But you're writing again, and I'm glad, old friend
I'll make sure you write me out of where you get to
(To, to, to) <br>

I was just gonna tell you
That I don't want to let you down
(Down down down) <br>
Get lost in the crowd
Seen or unseen
Say what you mean <br>

'Cause we all want to be here now <br>
And we all want to be held down <br>
And we all want to be here now <br>
And we all want to be held down <br>

I woke up, it was four in the morning
Clear as all hell that you'd already gone <br>
Your note said, "Dear, you know I hate to disappear
But the days are short and the nights are getting long" <br>

And I just mean to tell you
That I don't want to be let down 
Get lost in the crowd
Seen or unseen
Say what you mean
