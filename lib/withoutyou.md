# WITHOUT YOU
## Trippie Red & Travis Barker
Uh, uh
Uh

I'll go insane without you, pain without you
Feelings I crave without you, rage without you
I'll crash a plane about you, hate it without you
They know that you- that you are, I know you a star, oh
I'll go insane without you, pain without you
I'll crash a plane about you, hate it without you
I can't explain about you, ain't safe without you
It ain't the same without you, me without you (Bah)

I'll blow a brain about you, hate it when I-
I'll kill a gang about you, you're my love
No, I'm not insane without you, your love's a drug
When does it end?
With me, with me, with me, yeah
With me, with me, with me, yeah
With me, with me, with me, ooh
With me, with me, ooh, ooh

I'll go insane without you, pain without you
Feelings I crave without you, rage without you
I'll crash a plane about you, hate it without you
They know that you- that you are, I know you a star, oh
I'll go insane without you, pain without you
I'll crash a plane about you, hate it without you
I can't explain about you, ain't safe without you
It ain't the same without you, me without you (Bah)
