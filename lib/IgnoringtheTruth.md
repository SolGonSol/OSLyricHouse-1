# Ignoring The Truth
## Bear Hands
Textin' every kid on the block if you got a shot
Everyone say "Yeah, yeah, man, we got you"
Smile as I walk, tick and crack, we been gettin' on
Dying to survive, I ain't tried but I had to know

If you keep lookin' right past me
Something's gonna happen
Blood in, blood out
So we wrapped it in a napkin
No doubt, my heart broke, shattered like a glass bowl
Pissin' in the wind while you're ignoring the truth
While you're ignoring the truth
While you're ignoring the truth
Somehow it still finds you

I don't wanna talk, I don't wanna stop, I don't wanna join
I ain't gon' hold your hand
I'm too busy with my own shit, man
Got the cops on the corner and my mom's in my head

If you keep lookin' right past me
Something's gonna happen
Blood in, blood out
So we wrapped it in a napkin
No doubt, my heart broke, shattered like a glass bowl
Pissin' in the wind while you're ignoring the truth
Like you always do
While you're ignoring the truth
Somehow it still finds you
While you're ignoring the truth
While you're ignoring the truth
Somehow it still finds you
