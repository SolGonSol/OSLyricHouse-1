# Lemon 
## Local Natives
### [Verse 1] 
Sour lemon eyes <br>
Staring down the daylight <br>
And the LA River makes you laugh <br>
You say: "why’s a gutter got a name like that?" <br>

### [Chorus] 
You’re toweling up your wet hair <br>
I hear your coffee grind <br>
The credits rolling on last night’s late night
We’re always somewhere between
Leaving and arrived
I just wanna be here at the same time

### [Verse 2] 
Slouching when you walk <br>
Just like Hillhurst palms 
A penny and a lotto ticket to scratch
You win enough to keep you coming back

### [Chorus] <br>
A cross above the freeway
Holy neon light
Everybody crawling for their lives
You’re watching your reflection
In a TV turned off
How long you gonna pay more than it costs?
