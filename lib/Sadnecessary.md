# Sadnecessary
## Milky Chance

Mirror, mirror,<br>
Who's the happiest<br>
Is it the lover or is it the beloved<br>
And mirror, mirror,<br>
Can I blame you for this<br>
When heartbreakers came around<br>

You shot my heart<br>
Like a bullet all alone<br>
No when you leave me<br>
Just carry me slow home<br>

Mirror, mirror,<br>
Can I blame you for this<br>
When heartbreakers came around<br>

Sadnecessary is what you promise me<br>
All I can do is to follow the tears<br>
Deep down the hollow is what you promise me<br>
All I can do is to follow<br>

Sadnecessary is what you promise me<br>
All I can do is to follow the tears<br>
Deep down the hollow is what you promise me<br>
All I can do is to follow<br>
